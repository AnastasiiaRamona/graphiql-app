## Document scripts:

1. Start Development Server:

- Run `npm run dev` to start the development server. This will compile tsx files, bundle assets, and serve the application locally.

2. Compile TypeScript:

- Use `npm run build` to compile tsx files into JavaScript.

3. Run Tests:

- Execute `npm run test` to run Vitest tests. Ensure all tests pass before deploying any changes to production.

4. Linting:

- Utilize `npm run lint` to run the linter and ensure code consistency and adherence to coding standards.

5. Format code:

- Use `npm run format` to format code according to predefined style rules. This ensures consistent code formatting across the project.

6. Husky Setup:

- Husky is configured to run automatically before certain Git actions. Ensure that your configuration is correctly set up in the package.json file.

## Setup instructions:
